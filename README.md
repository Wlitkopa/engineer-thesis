# Regev's Algorithm for IBM Qiskit

This repository contains an implementation of the quantum Regev's algorithm. It is executed on a local quantum computer simulator using IBM Qiskit.

## Requirements

* Python version >= 3.11

## Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Wlitkopa/engineer-thesis.git

cd engineer-thesis
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment.
```bash
python -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the Regev's algorithm, execute the following script:

```bash
python regev_all.py
```

## Images and data

### Quantum Circuits

The quantum circuits images for different parameter configurations are available in the following folders:

- **images/general:** Contains the most general forms of the quantum circuits.
- **images/decomposed:** Contains slightly more detailed versions of the circuits, where one quantum gate type is decomposed into smaller gates.

### Output Data

The data obtained from running Shor's and Regev's algorithms is stored in the folder:

- **output_data**

### Plots

Graphs representing the research data depending on various parameters are stored in the folder:

- **images/plots**
